<p><a title="infinite threejs terrain part 1" href="/webgl/2015/07/26/threejs-infinite-world-webgl-part-1.html">Part 1</a>&nbsp;of this tutorial left off with just one column of tiles, and the ability to move along the Z axis infinitely. Here, we're going to build the full grid, and enable the same infinite movement across the X axis.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Step 1: Build up&nbsp;a grid</h3>
<p>Just by changing the X position of the tiles, they will apear to the side of the camera:</p>
<p><iframe style="box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; max-width: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vnBPgDxRnUI" width="359" height="202" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Now that we already have one row moving forwards, we can create two more rows either side of it to make a total of&nbsp;9 tiles in&nbsp;3 rows x 3 columns. The changes now are that in the constructor at the top of the terrainMatrix.js file, I have provided definitions for the tile height, width and row number to make the rest of the code easier to understand:&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:js;auto-links:false;toolbar:false">  function TerrainMatrix(){

    this.floor = [];
    this.tileHeight=100;
    this.tileWidth=100;
    this.tileRowNumber = 3;

  }</pre>
<p>Then, inside <code>createTerrainMatrix(</code>), all we need to do to add two extra rows is wrap the main contents with a for loop that will force the funciton to execute three times. However in addition to this, we provide an alternative&nbsp;X position for each of the three rows.</p>
<p>The alternative X position is created towards the top of the function where an xPos is defined. Just in side the loop, we set this X position for each of the three row iterations:&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:js;auto-links:false;toolbar:false">var xPos=0;
          //we want a 3 by 3 matrix
          for(var x = 1; x&lt;4; x+=1){
            console.log(x)
            if(x==1){
              xPos= -this.tileWidth;
            }
            else if(x==2){
              xPos= this.tileWidth;
            }
            else if (x==3){
              xPos = 0
            }<br /><br /></pre>
<h4>Setting the X Position&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first row (iteration of the loop) sets X to minus the tile width so it appears on the left</li>
<li>The second row sets&nbsp;X to 0 so it appears in the center where the camera is</li>
<li>The third row sets X to&nbsp;plus the tile width, so it appears to the right of the camera</li>
</ul>
<p>Bringing&nbsp;it all together, the rest of the function is exactly the same, except the X position is altered with.&nbsp;<code>ground.position.x = xPos</code>.</p>
<pre class="brush:js;auto-links:false;toolbar:false">  /**
   * Terrain functions
   */
  TerrainMatrix.prototype={

    constructor: TerrainMatrix,

    /**
     * createTerrainMatrix
     * @TODO: create the matrix of terrains - need to add 9 bits of terrain
     */
    createTerrainMatrix:function(scene, perlinNoise){

          var xPos=0;
          //we want a 3 by 3 matrix
          for(var row = 0; row&lt;3; row+=1){
            if(row==0){
              xPos= -this.tileWidth;
            }
            else if(row==1){
              xPos= this.tileWidth;
            }
            else if (x==2){
              xPos = 0
            }

            //every 100px on the z axis, add a bit of ground
            for ( var z= this.tileHeight; z &gt; (this.tileHeight * -this.tileRowNumber); z-=this.tileHeight ) {

              //Create the perlin noise for the surface of the ground
      	      var perlinSurface = new PerlinSurface(perlinNoise, this.tileWidth, this.tileHeight);
              var ground = perlinSurface.surface;
              //rotate 90 degrees around the xaxis so we can see the terrain
              ground.rotation.x = -Math.PI/-2;
              // Then set the z position to where it is in the loop (distance of camera)
              ground.position.z = z;
              ground.position.y -=4;

              ground.position.x =xPos;

              //add the ground to the scene
              scene.add(ground);
              //finally push it to the floor array
              this.floor.push(ground);
            }
          }

    },</pre>
<hr />
<h3>Step 2: Be less memory intensive</h3>
<p>One major alteration is required here for this to work. At the moment, we're creating terrain using <code>PlaneGeometry</code> in the <code>PerlinSurface</code>&nbsp;function:&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:js;auto-links:false;toolbar:false">//create the plane geometry
     this.geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(width,height,300,300);</pre>
<p>This is too memory intensive to create 9 pieces of terrain. Therefore we need to modify this function to use BufferGeometry, which luckily for us can be done in one line:</p>
<pre class="brush:js;auto-links:false;toolbar:false" contenteditable="false">      var bufferGeometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().fromGeometry( this.geometry)
</pre>
<p>Here, we use the <code>fromGeometry()</code> method to convert <code>PlaneGeometry</code> to <code>BufferGemetry</code>.<br />At this point we've got a 3 x 3 grid, and are able to move forward and backwards, but not left and right (without reaching the edge).</p>
<hr />
<h3>Step 3: Moving along the X axis</h3>
<p >Very similar code monitoring the Z axis can be used to detect when the camera moves left or right (along the X axis), allowing us to add terrain appropriately along the X axis.</p>
<p ><iframe style="box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; max-width: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhFnA_OnMTY" width="359" height="202" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p >Here is the code to be added to the <code>moveWithCamera()</code> function under the last if clause:&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:js;auto-links:false;toolbar:false">//x positions
          else if((this.floor[i].position.x - this.tileWidth)&gt;camera.position.x){

            this.floor[i].position.x-=(this.tileWidth*2);
          }
          //if the camera has moved past the entire square in the opposite direction, move the square the opposite way
          else if((this.floor[i].position.x + this.tileWidth)&lt;camera.position.x){

            this.floor[i].position.x+=(this.tileWidth*2);
          }</pre>
<p >It's exactly the same as the Z position checks, but monitors the X positions, and uses the <code>tileWidth</code> rather than <code>tileHeight</code>.</p>
<p >Now the user is trapped, as whatever direction they move, more terrain is 'created'.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Well done - but how can this be improved?</h3>
<p>You should now have an infinite terrain, but I'm sure this could be improved. After creating this tutorial, I have experimented with the size and number of tiles used to create this effect, and it can be done using just a 2 x 2 grid. Creating and updating just 4 tiles is much less intensive on memory than 9.</p>
